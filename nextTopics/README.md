## 🎯 Learning Path

```
Foundations (Days 1-7)
        ↓
TensorRT + Profiling (optimize models)
        ↓
LLM Inference (hottest skill in 2024)
        ↓
Custom Kernels (differentiate yourself)
        ↓
Distributed GPU (scale to production)
        ↓
Portfolio Projects (prove your skills)
```

## 💡 Why These Skills?

### Market Demand (2024-2025)
- **AI/ML Explosion**: Every company needs GPU acceleration
- **LLM Era**: Inference optimization is critical
- **Cost Pressure**: Efficient GPU usage = massive savings
- **Remote-First**: GPU work is highly remote-friendly

### Skill Rarity
- Few developers understand GPU internals
- Even fewer can optimize production systems
- High barrier to entry = high compensation
